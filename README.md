Daily challenges on Codewars with JavaScript


<h2>We need a function that can transform a number into a string.<br>
//What ways of achieving this do you know?</h2><br>

const numberToString = num => num.toString()


<h2>// In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?</h2><br>

function makeNegative(num) {<br>
  return(-Math.abs(num))<br>
}

<h2>// Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled. </h2><br>

class Kata {
  static getVolumeOfCuboid(length, width, height) {<br>
    let volume = (length * width * height)<br>
    return volume;<br>
  }<br>
}
